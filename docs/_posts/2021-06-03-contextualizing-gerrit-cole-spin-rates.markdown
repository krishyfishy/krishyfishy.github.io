Hello, world! I'm hoping this site can serve as a place that people can use to learn a bit more about me and my work.

My most recent project was an analysis of spin rates for pitchers across MLB. 

In 2018, [Trevor Bauer](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bauertr01.shtml) took to Twitter to [accuse](https://twitter.com/BauerOutage/status/991339034034233344) the Houston Astros pitching staff of doctoring baseballs. That same year, Gerrit Cole, an excellent pitcher, was traded to the Astros.

In March 2020, a longtime [Angels](https://www.mlb.com/angels) staffer named Brian "Bubba" Harkins was fired for allegedly providing pitchers with a [substance](https://www.latimes.com/sports/angels/story/2020-03-06/angels-employee-bubba-harkins-sold-homemade-substance-pitchers-applied-to-baseballs) that they subsequently used to doctor baseballs, called "Go-Go Juice." Following his dismissal, Harkins filed a lawsuit against the Angels and MLB, in which he named specific pitchers to whom he had provided Go-Go Juice, a mixture of pine tar and rosin. One of the pitchers he named was Gerrit Cole.

I used Statcast data from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search) to analyze and compare spin rates for Gerrit Cole with those of other pitchers named in the lawsuit.

Spoiler alert: Cole was a huge outlier compared to other pitchers named in the suit.
