A [well-traveled](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/science/stellers-sea-eagle.html), ultra-rare Steller's Sea-Eagle appeared in Georgetown, Maine last week. In the days since, thousands of birders have flocked to the area in hopes of seeing the bird. 

This past Saturday, I traveled to Maine with a friend of mine, Rebecca Ju. We got up early and drove three hours north to Georgetown, arriving at Five Islands Lobster Co. to see a crowd of birders searching the nearby islands for a large, dark silhouette. 

Steller's Sea Eagles can weigh up to twenty pounds, with wingspans that can reach eight feet in length. There are only about 4,000 of these birds across the globe. They're [believed](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/facts/stellers-eagle) to breed in eastern Russia. This bird has steadily made its way east after an [August 2020 stop](https://www.adn.com/outdoors-adventure/2020/09/05/in-a-far-from-normal-autumn-on-the-denali-highway-a-stellers-sea-eagle-makes-a-rare-appearance/) in Alaska. This Steller's Sea Eagle is the first EVER observed in Canada or the Lower 48.

Around 10:45 AM, news broke that the bird was near the wharf. It perched on the southern side of Mink Island, only visible by boat. Shortly after, the eagle flew further south to Wood Island, where it sat for a couple of hours.

An incredibly generous local lobsterman named Robbie Pinkham started taking groups of birders out on the water for a glimpse of the bird. Robbie didn't charge people for a spot on the boat, but he gladly accepted tips. And people were tipping him, for sure. Rebecca and I were two of those lucky people.

As we got in the boat, Robbie mentioned that the bird had been around the area for three or four days. He was impressed that a single bird could get so many people so excited. 

"I ain't never seen so many people riled up over a bird," he said.

Even though he'd seen the bird dozens of times by the time Rebecca and I saw it for the first time, Robbie was still fascinated by its beauty. All told, I'm guessing he brought around ten trips out to Mink and Wood Islands on Saturday.

Every time the boat came back in, the line of eagerly waiting birders had grown longer. The people getting off the boat were quick to show Robbie some love.

The [Grey Havens Inn](https://greyhavens.com/) also graciously let birders onto their property to see the bird from afar. Thank you to Doug Hitchcox, Maine Audubon, Nick Lund, and so many others for sharing information about this bird. Truly a special occurrence.
