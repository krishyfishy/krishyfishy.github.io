## TL;DR

I moved to California about six months ago. For me, a big way to get to know a new place is through the birds. 

During these months, I've been birding more than ever before. That's put me in touch with a lot of new people, a lot of new birds, and a lot of new language for talking about birds. 

Birding and meeting other birders has been fun, but some of the new language (jargon? lingo?) has been a little bit hard for me to understand. So I decided to start a document to keep track of the words I've learned. What follows is a glossary, of sorts, with my own interpretations of the words and links to articles or other resources that reference or touch on these words in some way.

I'd love for this project to be one I continue updating as I learn more. If you can think of a word or abbreviation that should be added, send me a DM on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/krishmaypole) or get in touch [via email](mailto:krish.maypole@gmail.com).

## The Glossary

### Terms

**Lifer:** A lifer is a bird that a birder is seeing for the first time. I've heard it used as both a noun ("That American Robin is a lifer for me!") and an adjective ("Today I had my lifer American Robin!").

This definition gets at a concept that's pretty central to birding: a life list. A lot of serious birders keep a list of all the birds they've ever seen before.

**Life list:** All of the unique species a birder has ever seen (tipped my hand a bit in the last definition.)

**eBird:** A [citizen science database](www.ebird.org) run by the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home) that allows birders to keep track of their life list, as well as all of the birds they've seen over more specific time periods. 

**Pishing:** Pishing refers to when birders make sounds in an effort to attract birds. The most common sound to make is a shortened version of "pish" (hence the name), though some people may mix in other sounds (e.g. "chit"). Why pish at all? The idea is to mimic an alarm call, which would cause nearby birds to investigate the cause (the pish-er). 

This [Audubon article](https://www.audubon.org/news/birdist-rule-77-use-your-voice-attract-birds) describes pishing in greater depth, and emphasizes that pishing works best for songbirds (birds that use and respond more to alarm calls in general).

When you're deciding whether or not to pish, it's important to consider the context. If you're with other birders, you should clear it with the group rather than pishing without warning. I've seen people pish without warning before, and I've also seen people get pretty upset.
 
**Twitching:** 

**Dipping:**

**Stringing:**

**Wing bars:**

**Supercilium:**

### Abbreviations

**LBJ:** "Little Brown Job" is an apt monicker for drab songbirds (I'm looking at you, wrens and sparrows).

**HY:** "Hatch Year" is a banding code that refers to an individual in its first calendar year of life. 

This [resource](https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/27-43%20OB%20Vol%2018%231%20Apr2000.pdf) goes into a lot more detail.

**SY:** "Second Year" is a banding code that refers to an individual in its second calendar year of life.

**Recs:** Short for "rectrices," which are actually just tail feathers.
