## Summary

I moved to California about six months ago. For me, a big way to get to know a new place is through the birds. 

During these months, I've been birding more than ever before. That's put me in touch with a lot of new people, a lot of new birds, and a lot of new language for talking about birds. 

Birding and meeting other birders has been fun, but some of the new language (jargon? lingo?) has been a little bit hard for me to understand. I decided to start a document to keep track of the words I've learned. What follows is a glossary, of sorts, with interpretations of the words and links to articles or other resources that reference or touch on these words in some way.

I'd love for this project to be one I continue updating as I learn more. If you can think of a word or abbreviation that should be added, send me a DM on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/krishmaypole) or get in touch [via email](mailto:krish.maypole@gmail.com).

## The Glossary

### Terms

**Lifer:** A lifer is a bird that a birder is seeing for the first time. I've heard it used as both a noun ("That American Robin is a lifer for me!") and an adjective ("Today I had my lifer American Robin!").

This definition gets at a concept that's pretty central to birding: a life list. A lot of serious birders keep a list of all the birds they've ever seen before.

**Life list:** All of the unique species a birder has ever seen (tipped my hand a bit in the last definition), tracked by pen-and-paper, online (see **eBird**), or some other means.

**Spark bird:** The bird, for a birder, that ignited the passion for birding. For me it was the Osprey.

**eBird:** A [citizen science database](www.ebird.org) run by the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home) that allows birders to keep track of their life list, as well as all of the birds they've seen over more specific time periods. 

**Pishing:** Pishing refers to when birders make sounds in an effort to attract birds. The most common sound to make is a shortened version of "pish" (hence the name), though some people may mix in other sounds (e.g. "chit"). Why pish at all? The idea is to mimic an alarm call, which would cause nearby birds to investigate the cause (the pish-er). 

This [Audubon article](https://www.audubon.org/news/birdist-rule-77-use-your-voice-attract-birds) describes pishing in greater depth, and emphasizes that pishing works best for songbirds (birds that use and respond more to alarm calls in general).

When you're deciding whether or not to pish, it's important to consider the context. If you're with other birders, you should clear it with the group rather than pishing without warning. I've seen people pish without warning before, and I've also seen people get pretty upset.
 
**Twitching:** Pursuing a rare bird.

**Dipping:** Missing out on seeing a bird (that you were looking for specifically). Another good [Audubon article](https://www.audubon.org/news/birdist-rule-81-learn-how-handle-your-first-dip) goes into more depth here. 

**Stringer:** A term that refers to a birder that caves to the impulse of reporting something rare too quickly. In other words, if a stringer were to see a bird that *could* have been a rare bird, they are likely to report it as rare without questioning or interrogating the sighting any further. 

I think there's a ["fish story"](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fish-story#:~:text=An%20improbable%2C%20boastful%20tale%2C%20as,Early%201800s%5D) parallel to be drawn here. An [American Birding Association Blog](https://blog.aba.org/2017/07/on-stringing.html#:~:text=More%20often%20a%20stringer%20is,their%20observational%20abilities%20and%20constraints.) dives deeper.

**Banding codes:** These are typically four-letter abbreviations of common bird names (e.g. American Robin is AMRO) constructed according to a [specific set of rules](https://www.carolinabirdclub.org/bandcodes.html) based on the specifics of the name. 

During the recent public fascination with Wordle, a bird banding code version was born: [BRDL](brdl.alex.gd). 

**Patch:** A place near home where one goes regularly. Again, [Audubon](https://www.audubon.org/news/want-training-ground-your-birding-skills-try-patch-birding) has a nice article on patch birding.

I've been doing a lot of patch birding in CA to get to know the area.

**Mega:** Used by birders to describe a sighting that was extremely rare. I see people put this as comments in their eBird checklists when they're reporting rarities.

### Abbreviations

**LBJ:** "Little Brown Job" is an apt moniker for drab songbirds (I'm looking at you, wrens and sparrows).

**HY:** "Hatch Year" is a banding code that refers to an individual in its first calendar year of life. 

This [resource](https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/27-43%20OB%20Vol%2018%231%20Apr2000.pdf) goes into a lot more detail.

**SY:** "Second Year" is a banding code that refers to an individual in its second calendar year of life.

**Recs:** Short for "rectrices," which are tail feathers.

**FO:** "Flyover" is used to describe birds that pass by an area in which you're birding.

**FOY:** "First of Year" is used in reference to the first individual of a particular bird species that a birder has seen in a calendar year.

## Other resources

Other folks have put together good resources for explaining bird-related terms and jargon. A couple that I've found are [this one](https://madisonaudubon.org/blog/2020/8/16/birding-lingo) by Caitlyn Schuchhardt of Madison Audubon and [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitchers%27_vocabulary#:~:text=Dip%20(or%20dip%20out)%3A,for%20photography%20rather%20than%20study.) from Wikipedia.
