Hi, I'm Krish. I recently graduated from Yale, where I studied biology, ecology, and data science. I'm passionate about using informative data and clear writing to put important insight into the hands of those who need it, from healthcare providers and policymakers to the general public.

At RTI International, I worked on several projects, including a report evaluatingÂ  the impacts of ALS Association funding following the 2014 ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, a dashboard for visualizing longitudinal survey data and paradata, and an assessment of value-based purchasing uptake in eleven states.

At Yale, I researched savanna plant communities in the Staver Lab, bird species distributions in the Jetz Lab, and bird feather pigments in the Prum Lab. I also had the privilege of taking a class with Carl Zimmer, an award-winning New York Times science writer, which led me to edit the science and technology section of the Yale Herald and write this piece about the rise of EEE Virus in New England. This past summer, I worked as a fact-checker on Zimmer's latest book, Life's Edge: A Search for What It Means to Be Alive.
