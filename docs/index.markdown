Hi, I'm Krish. I recently graduated from [Yale](yale.edu), where I studied **biology**, **ecology**, and **data science**. I'm passionate about using informative data and clear writing to put important insight into the hands of those who need it, from healthcare providers and policymakers to the general public.

At [RTI International](rti.org), I worked on several projects, including:
* A [report](https://www.als.org/sites/default/files/2020-06/RTI-Report-FINAL.pdf) evaluating the impacts of [ALS Association](als.org) funding following the 2014 [ALS Ice Bucket Challenge](https://www.als.org/stories-news/ice-bucket-challenge-dramatically-accelerated-fight-against-als),
* A [dashboard](https://www.rti.org/rti-press-publication/interactive-visualization) for visualizing longitudinal survey data and paradata, and
* An assessment of value-based purchasing uptake in eleven states.

At Yale, I researched savanna plant communities in the [Staver Lab](staverlab.yale.edu), bird species distributions in the [Jetz Lab](jetzlab.yale.edu), and bird feather pigments in the [Prum Lab](prumlab.yale.edu). I also had the privilege of taking a class with [Carl Zimmer](carlzimmer.com), an award-winning New York Times science writer, which led me to edit the science and technology section of the [Yale Herald](yale-herald.com) and write [this piece](https://yale-herald.com/2020/01/24/a-viral-climate-eee-and-its-unnerving-future-in-new-england/) about the rise of EEE Virus in New England. This past summer, I worked as a fact-checker on Zimmer's [latest book](https://carlzimmer.com/books/lifes-edge/), Life's Edge: A Search for What It Means to Be Alive.
