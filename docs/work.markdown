## Projects

* [**Evaluated spin rates for pitchers across Major League Baseball**](https://github.com/krishyfishy/baseball/blob/main/spin_rate_investigation.ipynb) to assess whether pitchers may be doctoring baseballs, which would ostensibly result in spikes in their spin rates. Data came from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search), and I did the analysis in `Python`. Final project for Yale's Analysis of Baseball Data course with Prof. Ethan Meyers. 

* [**Conducted a randomized experiment**](https://github.com/krishyfishy/paper-airplanes) assessing whether the addition of a paperclip to paper airplanes increases flight distances. Analyses coded in `R`. Final project for PLSC 341 with Prof. Alex Coppock.

* [**Contributed to a report assessing the impacts of ALS Association funding**](https://www.als.org/sites/default/files/2020-06/RTI-Report-FINAL.pdf) following the 2014 ALS Ice Bucket Challenge during my time at RTI International.
